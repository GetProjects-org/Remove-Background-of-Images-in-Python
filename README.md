# Remove-Background-of-Images-in-Python

In the era of video calling, sometimes we don’t want to broadcast our background space for some reason. That’s why video calling applications include a feature that hides the background and places another image in the background. So in this project i.e. Remove Background of Images in Python, we’re going to make our own image background removal application using OpenCV and MediaPipe framework.
